            <ul>
                <li>28 ounces freshly ground beef (preferably the Blue Label Burger Blend; ground chuck will do)</li>
                <li></li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>4 slices cheese (I recommend American or cheddar)</li>
                <li>4 soft hamburger buns, lightly toasted</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Toppings and condiments as desired</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat broiler to high</li>
                <li>Divide meat into four equal 7-ounce portions and gently shape each one into a patty 4.5-inches wide by approximately 3/4-inch thick.</li>
                <li>Place patties on foil-lined broiler pan and position so that tops of patties are 2 1/2 to 3 inches below the broiler elements or flame.</li>
                <li>Broil for 3 minutes until top is well browned and begging to char.</li>
                <li>Flip patties and continue to broil until center reads 130 degrees on an instant read thermometer for medium-rare, about 3 minutes longer. Adjust cooking time if you want them more or less cooked. </li>
                <li>Top each patty with a slice of cheese, place back under broiler for 25 seconds to melt, place on buns, top as desired, and serve. </li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>   
            </ol>
