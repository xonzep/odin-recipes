            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                All hail the Baked Bacon Ranch Chicken! You guys made yourselves loud and clear when I posted our 4 Ingredient Creamy Caesar Chicken. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It quickly rose to one of the most popular recipes on The Cookie Rookie within weeks of when I published. I knew I had to think of some other easy options that were similar but with different flavors, and this Ranch Baked Chicken with Bacon was formed!

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 375°F and spray an 8 x 11-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>If the breasts are uneven in thickness, pound them to an even 1” thickness using a meat pounder.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle both sides of meat with half the grated Parmesan cheese, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place the chicken in the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li> In a medium bowl, whisk together Ranch dressing and sour cream. Pour the mixture over the chicken breasts and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake at 375°F for 20-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast reads 150°F.</li>
                <li>Set oven to broil and broil the breast an additional 2-4 minutes or until the chicken turns golden. It will burn quickly so watch closely.</li>
                <li>The chicken is cooked through when the thermometer reads 160°F when inserted in the thickest part of the middle breast.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with cooked bacon crumbles. Allow the chicken to rest a few minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Garnish with diced parsley, if desired.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
